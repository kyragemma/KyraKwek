									<p>Jiu Jitsu, getting comfortable with the uncomfortable <br>and its prominence in my personal and professional life</p>

								<p>My jiu jitsu journey started in 2018 with a conversation on the balcony with my stepdad on a sullen, windy night. I had been going through a very rough time in my life when my stepdad popped a question I had never once pondered: “Have you thought of anything you could possibly channel all these emotions towards?” I sat in silence, filing through my thoughts for some time. “Well, I remember wanting more than anything than to be able to train in MMA back when I was 9.” The next day, we walked to the closest gym and got myself signed up for a trial week at the gym.
								<p>I fell in love with Jiu Jitsu because the idea of an endless vortex of techniques thrilled me. Rather than daunting me, the concept of never being able to run out of techniques in the sport thrilled me beyond measure. One class a week turned into three, and before I knew it, I found myself coming up with excuses to skip my after-school basketball practices to devote my time on the jiu jitsu mats.
								<p>Many days I found myself walking back home from the gym in tears, grabbing onto my elbow in excruciating pain from being tapped out so many times, or just finding myself scoffing at the idea of ever being able to survive a sparring round with an opponent even just 10 pounds heavier than I was. But of all the things I’d done in my life up to that point, I actually did something different. I continued to show up. On days that I couldn’t show up in my performance in the sport, I compensated with showing up to illustrate to myself the grit that had been there all along.
								<p>What started as a sport intended to keep myself busy and learn some basic self defence moves brought me some of the most valuable lessons that I continue to carry forward in my daily life. From the ability to get comfortable in the uncomfortable, to cultivating whole-hearted trust in my own journey in life, school and the sport, it continues to astound me how one of the longest, darkest periods of my life had brought me to know the sport that would equip me with lessons that would last long after I step off the mats. It was through jiu jitsu that I was able to push through one more hour of finishing a project no matter how exhausted I was, and it was through jiu jitsu that I learned to get up again so that I could show up as a daughter, friend, student and for myself through the turbulence of life.

								<p>Over the years of training in jiu jitsu in both Singapore and Texas, I’ve gotten the honour of making many unforgettable memories competing, partnering with sponsors, learning from people of all walks of life and meeting some of my closest friends to date. I have also been fortunate enough to translate my passion for the sport into giving back to my community, from coaching kids to volunteering to demonstrate and assist in self defence seminars for young women.
