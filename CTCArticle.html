									<h1>Candles that Care</h1>
									<p>How a small venture to learn how to make homemade candles<br />
										became a mission to change lives for the better. </p>

								<p>It all started with a sniff. I noticed the fresh, fruity fragrance of a burning candle in my living room and wondered how candles were made and how the wicks stayed upright during pouring. Within three days, I had candle-making supplies shipped from Amazon, eager to find the answers myself. I envisioned making candles to sell or give as gifts for the upcoming holidays, and thatâ€™s how Project Light Up My Life under my brand name, Candles that Care, was born.

									Every day after school, I spent hours experimenting with candle-making. Initially, I faced setbacks, like ordering the wrong type of soy wax, resulting in cracked and defective candles. However, I eventually perfected the recipe and conditions. I created a logo and labels for my three starting fragrances and enlisted the help of my high school friends to share the joy and skills of candle-making.

									To promote my brand, I collaborated with my school's media manager and secured a table at the Winter Fair. Soon, I was delivering candles to students across the grade. In three months, I exceeded my initial goal of $800, reaching over $1,500 in sales, which I fully donated to UNICEF's campaign to provide hand soaps, masks, and COVID-19 vaccine doses to children in third-world countries.

									Despite having to put Candles that Care aside due to high school commitments, the experience taught me valuable lessons in managing capital and profits, and developing leadership skills. Most importantly, knowing I could light up the lives of those who supported me and those across the globe left a lasting impact on my heart.</p>
