									<h1>Engineering<br />

									<p>A look into my first CAD project in collaboration </br>

								<p>As part of my BME303L (Introduction to Biomedical Engineering) course, my group mates and I were tasked with executing our first CAD modelling project in the span of 5 weeks. This particular project focused mostly on being able to familiarise ourselves with not only designing on Fusion360 but with identifying customer needs and designing a product that addresses these demands. To do this, we would have to establish a customer need and an existing ‘solution’ to the issue. We would then add our own modification to the product by creating a new version of it through CAD. </p>
								<p>Some of the customer needs that we filed through included creating more comfortable and ergonomic air masks, childproof door handles and cups with grooves to catch drips. However, we ended up choosing to focus on creating an anti-slip coaster for cups and drinks. We identified this issue upon our observation of often narrow tables in student dorms and apartments, along with the general concern for child safety when around hot beverages. </p>
								<p>There were several existing coasters and cup caddies that attempted to address the issue that we had taken upon including a traditional cork coaster and a cup caddy that could be clamped onto the width of a table. However, we recalled the Mighty Mug, which gained much popularity a couple years back for its ‘unspillable’ feature. Upon much research and incorporating understandings of air pressure and suctions, we were able to dissect the suction portion of the mug into individual components.</p>

								<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Hole captures air between surface and mug to act as a suction. A loose connecting piece between the coaster base and suction piece allows for air to be reintroduced into the closed system when the mug is vertically lifted.</figcaption></br>
								<p>To get to our solution, we had to gather multiple dimensions through research and measurement to gauge the rough diameter for our prototype before completing a rough sketch of our targeted product. This step came in extremely useful in helping us as a group to unanimously agree upon the product that we had designed up to that point. With all our measurements in hand, we could finally work on modelling the product components (including the suction portion, coaster walls and silicone flaps). Assembling the final product was undoubtedly the toughest of the steps due to having to run through the trial and error process to determine the ideal materials and appearances to optimise cost and practicality. </p>

								<p>Our journey through this CAD modelling project has been both challenging and rewarding. Over the course of five weeks, we successfully familiarised ourselves with Fusion360, honed our skills in identifying and addressing customer needs, and developed a practical solution to a common problem. The anti-slip coaster we designed not only incorporates innovative features like air suction to prevent spills but also addresses safety concerns in environments such as student dorms and family homes.</p>
