									<h1>Population Simulation<br/>
										Project
									</h1>
									<p>Learn more about how our group of 8 were able to create a simulation using Python to model the relationship between the Sea turtle and shark populations of the Gulf of Mexico, as inspired by the 2010 events of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
										<p><br/>This project was made possible with the collaboration of Harrison Teng, Abigail Tomaski, Joshua Wirogo, Nicole Randazzo, Lillyana Cruz, Ricardo Torres & Sophia De La Torre. </p>

								<p>To conclude a challenging semester of our BME303 (Introduction to Computing) course at the University of Texas at Austin, I collaborated with seven group members to model interactions between multiple agents during a specific event. Inspired by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, we aimed to better understand and predict the long-term effects of such large-scale disasters.
								<p>With three weeks to complete the project, we divided our group into two teams: one focused on ideas and the other on coding. This division allowed us to work efficiently and achieve optimal results in both presentation and coding.
								<p>We began by creating formulas to represent the death and reproduction events of green sea turtle and shark populations, as well as the oil concentration within a specified area. These formulas were incorporated into our code, which used a random number generator to determine event outcomes. Graphing functions were embedded to produce 2D and temporal evolution graphs of population changes.

								</div>
								<p>The ideas team then articulated our findings into a presentation for our BME303 class. This project was memorable as it was the largest and most complex I had worked on under such a tight time constraint. It not only familiarised us with Python beyond the classroom but also highlighted the importance of leveraging the strengths within a groupâ€”an essential skill for future large-scale projects.
