									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>My story of how adversity has shaped my goals, <br />
										values and love for learning.</p>
								</header>

								<p>Born and raised in Singapore till I was 16, I consider the 'little red dot' my home and continue to hold very close ties with my nation. It was back home that I developed my passion for problem solving. I’d often find myself digging through scrap materials in the house and using spare change to head to the nearby stationary store to buy extra materials for my construction endeavours. At the core of it all, I simply wanted to understand how the world around me worked. I realised that I bore something that did not discriminate against social class or family structure—curiosity. Curiosity taught me to learn, and learning taught me to appreciate the world for what it is and what it can be.

									<p>During much of my childhood, I was fortunate enough to have travelled to neighbouring nations such as Malaysia, Thailand, Japan and Vietnam, where I cultivated my love for culture, diversity tradition. Over the years, many of these countries that hold a very dear place in my heart have been plagued by wars and natural disasters, with one of the prominent issues during such times was the struggle to transport a steady supply of nutritious food that could maintain sterility as countries recuperated from such catastrophic events. This is where my initial interest in product and packaging engineering was piqued, with one of my primary goals being to design packagings that will allow for the transportation of fresh and enriching foods to disaster relief victims worldwide.

									<p>I wouldn’t be where I am today without the people I have crossed paths with, particularly my mother, who raised me single-handedly for 13 years before she met my stepdad. Witnessing my mother’s fortitude through many years of adversity was the greatest lesson that no classroom could teach me. Through tears and sacrifices, my mother ensured that I could receive the gift of education to pave a better life for myself than she had. As such, my greatest goal is to be able to create a scholarship foundation for single parents and children of single parents across the globe to ensure that their familial circumstances are never a barrier to receiving a world-class education. </p>
